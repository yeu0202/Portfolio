        The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intractable.simm" target="_blank">Simm</a> project is a native Android learning app that teaches people about their phones. I worked on this project with three other programmers, a designer, and an artist. <br>
        I spent two weeks doing a Kotlin bootcamp and learning about programming with Android as it was new to me. I learned a lot working on this project, as I was programming in a new language, the structure of the app was different, and I was interacting with more native Android api.<br><br>
        I implemented many sections of the storage system, the logic behind showing progress, Unity integration, multiple aspects of the home page, the sound effects, and other sections here and there.<br><br>
        I've acquired a multitude of skills working on this project. I learned about the MVVM model, which separates the GUI and the logic of the app apart. There was a huge learning curve and it took me a while to understand the roles of each level of script and how they interact. I learned how to incorporate Unity, built into a website, into Android. This enabled the other Unity programmer and I to code in a more familiar environment and also create interactive scenes more easily. I learned of ways to structure a scenes and data for easier testing, flexibility, and expandability.

          The app gives the user apps as they progress, to demonstrate the person growing and learning. I was in charge of the logic behind calculating which plant images, animations, and other relevant information to show.

        <div class="descriptionText">
          I did the research on how to incorporate Unity or other game engines into the native Android app. In the end, I settled on compiling the Unity build into a website, which can then be loaded from the app's internal files. This method gave us an easy way to add Unity scenes into the app. As our game programmers were more familiar with Unity, and the other programmers weren't familiar with creating more complex interactions in Android, this was a good solution for the team. <br>
          The Unity website can communicate with the Android app both ways, which was very helpful for flexibility and expandability.
