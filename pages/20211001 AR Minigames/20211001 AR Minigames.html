        This was my final project for my Master's Programme. The title is Exploration of Interactions in Augmented Reality Through Minigames. In this project, I explored different methods of interaction available in augmented reality by creating a series of minigames in Unity. 
        I created five minigames that utilize the phone's gyroscope, raycasting, plane detection, and image recognition in different ways. 
        I chose to work on this for my final project as I had used AR Foundation a little in other projects, and wanted to develop my skills in that further. <br><br>
        I learned quite a lot working on this project, I wrote better code throughout the project, had a cleaner code base, and more legible code. I also learned a lot about developing AR games in Unity. I learned some things about the way physics in Unity works, I also learned about giving good visual and audio feedback to players when actions are performed.

          This is a video that gives an overview of my process and final result of my project. <br>
          <br>
          All five minigames I created had their individual issues and difficulties, but I found the wire maze and tower block games the most challenging to implement. 
          The wire maze game required locking rotations in some axis but not others. Other people also had trouble trying to play it as, it wasn't too intuitive to play, since your point of view is also where the player's handle is. In the end, the game worked, but still needed improvements to be playable in an intuitive way. 
          The tower block minigame had issues where the blocks were exploding away from each other. I managed to figure out the problem, which was that the gravity was too high for the scale of the objects. This was a flaw in Unity's game engine, but turning the gravity down was a good enough workaround to make the game playable. The way the pieces were pulled out of the tower was also not very intuitive. I was able to play the game a lot more easily than others due to me knowing how it was implemented.

        <h4>Future Development</h4>
        <div class="descriptionText">
          These games can all be developed further. They are all playable, but the controls for some of the games are less intuitive than others. I am pretty pleased with how much I have learned and what I have produced. I hope to be able to use the skills I have learned here in future projects.
          The project could be improved by making more game that utilise features more unique to AR like plane detection, image recognition, and other kinds of computer vision.

        <h4>Additional comments</h4>
        <div class="descriptionText">
          I had some techinical difficulties making this project, but managed to solve all the ones that were blocking my progress.
          Currently, the project works better as a proof of concept rather than a fully fledged game, and needs more tweaking and improvements to be a marketable product.
