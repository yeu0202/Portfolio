        This is the Biomimicry Project, the first project for Debbie's class.<br>
        The first step was to observe nature and draw sketches to get inspiration from anything in nature.<br>
        Then we made a mind map of things we observed and expanded it by linking word associations.<br>
        We generated project ideas by mashing up two things we liked from our nature mind map and trying to brainstorm a project from that.<br>
        We ended up making a project where the bark of a tree trunk imitates the waves in a pond or small body of water.

          We could definitely develop this project further. As mentioned in the video, the tree could definitely be made to look more organic. 
          We could also receive input data from sources other than water ripples.<br>
          I will also remake this video according to feedback received from instructors to polish it up.

        <h4>Additional comments</h4>
        <div class="descriptionText">
          This project was really fun, learning how to connect Python with Unity with UDP packets was interesting. 
          There were some technical difficulties with that but we managed to figure out how to get around it. 
          Even though using UDP packets worked, a better method would definitely be helpful as there is a limit to packet size. <br>
          Working on the Biomimicry Project was also very different from what I was used to doing. 
          As a programmer I wasn't used to generating ideas and making things that are not tools or for entertainment. This project was more art related but it was surprisingly fun.
