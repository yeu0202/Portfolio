        This was a small project I did for Magnus's Locative Media mini project. We basically had a week to make a small locative project. 
        I decided to try making an augmented reality sheep herding game. This game idea is simple but I would need to learn quite a bit to be able to implement it in AR.<br><br>
        I learned quite a bit about using ARFoundation in Unity and manipulating objects in the real world relative to the Unity scene. I learned how to use plane detection along with placing objects in the AR scene to create this game. <br>

          First, I made a simple sheep herding game in Python on a 2d screen. This allowed me to figure out the logic behind the game before implementing it in AR. <br>
          Then, I experimented with AR in Unity. I spent a lot of time trying to place objects properly, and place them where I wanted them. 
          A lot of time was spent testing, as each time I wanted to test the program I had to upload it to my phone and compilation took several minutes. 
          After a lot of adjusting numbers and objects, I was able to get a general flexible play area generate with a single tap on the screen. 
          After being able to get all the objects generate properly, I was then able to translate the sheep herding game I made in Python to C# in Unity.

        <h4>Additional comments</h4>
        <div class="descriptionText">
          I think spending the time to figure out the logic in Python helped me save a lot of experimentation time in Unity. 
          When importing the code to Unity, I already knew the code would work, and saved myself the time needed to compile the program and test the edge cases.
          I uploaded both the <a href="https://github.com/yeu0202/Sheep-herding" target="_blank">Python game</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/yeu0202/ARSheepHerding" target="_blank">AR Unity game</a> onto github.
