        The NSS project was a project where all the students in Creative Technology were invited to work together to create a website where other students could vote on a charity of their choice. 
        The university will donate 5 pounds for each vote to a chosen charity. <br>
        I was in charge of leading everyone for this project. It was pretty slow and hard to get everyone working together to start with, but we managed to get the project finished in the end.

          Here is my illustration for the second idea which is based off of an illustration Paulina sent.

          This is my initial idea for the how the login page could look. 
          I was thinking that it should be simple with the NSS and charity logos, with some description to let the students know why they are voting. 
          Students can then either input their email address or their own unique code to access the voting page.

        <h4>Additional comments</h4>
        <div class="descriptionText">
          I was in charge of leading the project and making sure everything was on track and overseeing everything. 
          I took part in most of the steps along the way, but other people did most of the hard work. <br>
          I learned some things about working with people, especially over the internet instead of in person. I also learned some things about working on large group projects. 
          When working with people over the internet it is hard to coordinate things when not everyone responds in a timely fashion. 
          It is also hard to communicate ideas, especially if someone doesn't have good internet. Having a set meeting time every week helped with making sure people show up to a meeting. 
          I also found it important not to have a person leading a group or sub-group especially if they aren't reliable and don't always show up on time/at all to meetings. 
          When working in large group projects, you tend to have an imbalance of the proportion of work that is shared among people. 
          There tends to be a small percentage of people that do most of the work. 
          This might not necessarily because others don't want to or are unable to, but it seems to be more efficient to have a few people do most of the work. 
          Of course, this probably only applies to smaller projects that have less moving parts and components that need to be put together.
