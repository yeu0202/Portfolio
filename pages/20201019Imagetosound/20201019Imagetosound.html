        This was a class taught by Carl where students experimented with converting images to sound files and back. <br/>
        A filter or effect was applied on the sound file before converting it back to an image.<br/>
        Software used was Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Audition.

          The sound was inverted, which inverted the colors in the image. <br/>
          The minus 10db effect removed some detail as it probably shifted all the values closer to one end.

          The flanger effect in sound mixes the same signal with itself but one is slightly delayed with a changing period.<br/>
          These can be noticed in the triangles behind some lines in the image. <br/>
          I think that the height of a triangle might have something to do with the way sound is sampled.

          This phaser filter is a lot stronger than the default one.<br/>
          There seems to be some sort of echo effect built into the phaser effect.

          While this has happened on the person and the edges of the court glass boundaries, there are some grainy artefacts on the walls and the floor that I didn't expect.

          This image was processed through a stronger low pass filter. <br/>
          Both the blurring that was expected and the artefacts are stronger.<br/>
          I find this effect pretty interesting, further investigation will be needed to understand why the artefacts happen.

          There are plenty of other audio filters out there to test. It would be nice if there was an easy way to process colour images that makes sense. 
          I'm sure that can be done with a bit of programming to process the images into audio files and back in the way I want.
          <br>
          It would also be interesting to see if you could turn audio data into images and put an image filter over them, then convert them back. 
          One issue with that is that it might be harder to detect the subtle changes in sound.
