        This is the London Bridge Project, the final project for Debbie's class. For this project I worked with Isaac.<br>
        We were given a brief by James from the London Bridge Experience. 
        We were to redesign two attractions in the London Bridge Experience, adding technology to the attraction and make it engaging. 
        We were tasked to create a 5 minute educational and horror experience plus a quick 10 second clown themed jumpscare. <br>
        First, we did some research on the history of the London Bridge, from when the first one was built all the way to the present day.<br>
        Then, we researched and brainstormed ways to scare people, as the London Bridge Experience was a horror attraction. 
        We then used our research to generate a number of ideas for each attraction we were working on, and narrowed those ideas down after some discussion with Debbie and the other instructors.<br>
        For our final product, we had designed an immersive experience for the first room of the London Bridge Experience, and an AR clown jumpscare for another room.
        By using Unity and Photoshop, we compiled a video and images to present our ideas to the client. <br><br>
        In this project, I learned about how to brainstorm, design, and prepare ideas to present to a client. The main aim of this project was to show the client our various ideas, present them so they are easy to understand, and develop the ideas further based on the client's needs.

        <div class="descriptionText">
          I had fun working on this project, and it was a great learning experience. I previously disliked horror and hadn't had much contact with it.
          I had done quite a lot of research on the horror genre and techniques that I could use as horror devices. <br>
          I also learned quite a bit on the technical front. I learned a few new techniques working with Unity, like putting videos in the scene and using a shader to remove green screen from a video.
          This shader code was also useful to just remove the background from some images. I also used a few settings in the Unity inspector that I had previously not used. 
          It was also my first time using SparkAR, which I found quite intuitive and had similar controls to Unity, which helped.
          There were also plenty of tutorials online that could help with creating what I wanted. I found SparkAR to be a very intuitive, useful, and well made software for creating AR filters. <br>
          I also learned that Unity is quite useful in demonstrating a concept in 3D. The instructors and other students liked the way I used Unity to present some of my ideas.
          I'm very pleased with the final product, especially since I had put a lot of effort and time into it.
